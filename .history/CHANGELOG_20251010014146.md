## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-10 **hotfix**

[Diff](https://github.com/yua134/TempRef/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)

### Changed

#### **Breaking Changes**

- Unified return types of locking functions to `Temp`:
  - `mutex::Temp::reset`
  - `mutex::Temp::try_reset`
  - `rwlock::Temp::reset`
  - `rwlock::Temp::try_reset`
- These functions no longer return `MutexGuard` or `RwLockWriteGuard` directly.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `reset` closure was not executed in some cases.
- Fixed a typo in the Changelog.

### Planned

- `TempRef::dismiss()` was considered for this release but has been deferred to the next update.

### Note

- I'm truly sorry for the repeated breaking changes.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-09 **hotfix**

[Diff](https://github.com/yua134/TempRef/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0)

### Changed

#### **Breaking Changes**

- Unified return types of locking functions to `TempRef`:
  - `mutex::Temp::lock`
  - `mutex::Temp::try_lock`
  - `rwlock::Temp::write`
  - `rwlock::Temp::try_write`
- These functions no longer return `MutexGuard` or `RwLockWriteGuard` directly.
  Callers must now handle `TempRef`, which ensures the `reset` closure is always executed on drop.

- Fixed an issue where the `reset` closure was not executed in some cases.

### Planned
